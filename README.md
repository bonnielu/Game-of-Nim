# Game-of-Nim
The Game of Nim starts off with a randomized amount of stones. You may only take 1, 2, or 3 stones, and the objective of the game is to not take the last stone. My first attempt at creating a program that uses a basic beginner and expert AI to recreate the Game of Nim. Collaborated with 2 other friends on this.
